# Azure Service Bus hosting integration

Use this integration to model, configure, and orchestrate Azure Service Bus in an Aspire solution.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

### Add the integration

From your AppHost directory, add the `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus` integration with the Aspire CLI:

```bash
aspire add Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ServiceBus
```

## Configure Azure Provisioning for local development

Adding Azure resources to the AppHost model will automatically enable development-time provisioning
for Azure resources so that you don't need to configure them manually. Provisioning requires a number of settings
to be available via AppHost configuration. From your AppHost directory, set these values with `aspire secret set`:

```bash
aspire secret set Azure:SubscriptionId "<your subscription id>"
aspire secret set Azure:ResourceGroupPrefix "<prefix for the resource group>"
aspire secret set Azure:Location "<azure location>"
```

> NOTE: Developers must have Owner access to the target subscription so that role assignments
> can be configured for the provisioned resources.

## Usage example

In the AppHost, add a Service Bus connection and reference it from another resource with either C# or TypeScript:

**C#**

```csharp
var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("sb");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyService>()
                       .WithReference(serviceBus);
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
const serviceBus = await builder.addAzureServiceBus("sb");

const myService = await builder.addNodeApp("myService", "../my-service", "server.js")
                       .withReference(serviceBus);
```

### Emulator usage

Aspire supports using the Azure Service Bus emulator. To use the emulator, add the following to your AppHost project:

```csharp
// AppHost
var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("sb").RunAsEmulator();
```

When the AppHost starts up, a local container running the Azure Service Bus emulator will be started. By default it is accompanied by a SQL Server resource that the emulator uses to store its state, unless an existing SQL Server resource is provided with `WithSqlServer` (see below). The emulator waits for its SQL Server to become healthy before it starts.

That SQL Server resource can be customized using the regular SQL Server integration APIs, for instance to persist its state in a data volume or use a specific container name:

```csharp
// AppHost
var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("sb").RunAsEmulator(emulator => emulator
    .WithSqlServer(sql => sql
        .WithDataVolume()
        .WithContainerName("myproject-servicebus-sql")));
```

Alternatively, the emulator can reuse an existing SQL Server resource instead of creating one for itself:

```csharp
// AppHost
var sql = builder.AddSqlServer("sql");

var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("sb").RunAsEmulator(emulator => emulator
    .WithSqlServer(sql));
```

> NOTE: Customizing the SQL Server resource created for the emulator and reusing an existing one are mutually exclusive and throw an exception when combined.

## Connection Properties

When you reference Azure Service Bus resources using `WithReference`, the following connection properties are made available to the consuming project:

### Service Bus namespace

The Service Bus namespace resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Host` | The hostname of the Service Bus namespace |
| `Port` | The port of the Service Bus namespace when the emulator is used |
| `Uri` | The connection URI, with the format `sb://myservicebus.servicebus.windows.net` |
| `ConnectionString` | **Emulator only.** Includes SAS key material for the local emulator connection. |

### Service Bus queue

The Service Bus queue resource inherits all properties from its parent Service Bus namespace and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `QueueName` | The name of the queue |

### Service Bus topic

The Service Bus topic resource inherits all properties from its parent Service Bus namespace and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `TopicName` | The name of the topic |

### Service Bus subscription

The Service Bus subscription resource inherits all properties from its parent Service Bus topic and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `SubscriptionName` | The name of the subscription |
| `ConnectionString` | The connection string for the subscription |

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `db1` becomes `DB1_URI`.
