# GitHub Workflows

## Agentic workflow maintenance

The manual-only [CI Shepherd transport proof](ci-shepherd/README.md) is a bounded
no-effect experiment. Its Python behavioral tests and pinned-compiler commands
are separate from the existing Infrastructure.Tests contracts.

Agentic workflows are authored in `.github/workflows/*.md`. Upgrade the active
compiler to the latest stable release and inspect its suggested migrations before
recompiling:

```shell
gh extension upgrade aw
gh aw version
gh aw fix
gh aw compile --force-refresh-action-pins
gh aw compile
```

`gh aw fix` is a dry run unless `--write` is supplied. Its write mode also refreshes
authoring agents and skills; apply source migrations deliberately rather than
adding unrelated scaffolding. Keep the pinned `setup-cli` action and its `version`
input in `copilot-setup-steps.yml` aligned with the compiler used to generate the
workflows and with `validate-agentic-workflows.yml`. Updating only the setup
action does not update the installed compiler; its `version` input controls that.

Commit the generated `.lock.yml` files and `.github/aw/actions-lock.json` alongside
their source changes. `agentics-maintenance-microsoft-aspire.dev.yml` is generated
by the same full compilation despite not having a `.lock.yml` suffix. Do not edit
generated workflows manually. The second compilation should produce no further
changes.

`validate-agentic-workflows.yml` recompiles with the pinned gh-aw version, checks
for generated-file drift, runs `gh aw lint --shellcheck` as a blocking lint gate,
and runs the `Category=AgenticWorkflow` contracts in `Infrastructure.Tests`.
It also runs the CI Shepherd Python behavioral suite; changes to its helpers,
tests, and policies trigger this validation, while README-only changes do not.
Class-level traits group generated-workflow, validation trigger/drift, and shared
process-runner tests without including unrelated negative-test diagnostics.
Apply this trait to new agentic contract classes so dedicated validation includes them.
Main CI covers selector routing when the trigger map or lint policy changes.
README-only changes do not trigger dedicated agentic validation; new Markdown
workflow sources still trigger it even before their generated locks exist.

Compile-time lint diagnostics alone are not a blocking gate. The lint command
owns the actionlint image and compatibility exceptions; `.github/actionlint.yaml`
only scopes the known stale-check output workaround to the affected generated
workflows.

Explicit action versions in Markdown survive recompilation, so update deprecated
inputs and action runtimes in the sources, not just the generated YAML. The
`client-id` input to `actions/create-github-app-token` replaces `app-id`; the
existing `ASPIRE_BOT_APP_ID` secret remains the identity source.

Action upgrades must update Markdown references before regenerating locks and
the action-pin cache. A generated-only pin update is not reproducible and the
drift check rejects it, even if the changed action versions are otherwise valid.

The compiler's diagnostic `agent` artifact does not include arbitrary files from
`/tmp/gh-aw/agent/`. Workflows that publish custom agent files must upload a named
artifact in `post-steps`, allowlist only the required paths, and download it in the
consuming safe-output job. CI analysis and milestone changelogs use this pattern;
their canonical safe-output JSON remains compiler-managed.

`locker.yml` still uses the archived `microsoft/vscode-github-triage-actions`
Node 20 action. There is no supported Node 24 upgrade for that dependency;
replacing it requires a separate migration of its authentication and locking
behavior, rather than merely changing an action pin.

## Quarantine/Disable Test Workflow

The `apply-test-attributes.yml` workflow allows repository maintainers to quarantine, unquarantine, disable, or enable tests directly from issue or PR comments.

### Commands

| Command | Description | Attribute Used |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `/quarantine-test` | Mark test(s) as quarantined (flaky) | `[QuarantinedTest]` |
| `/unquarantine-test` | Remove quarantine from test(s) | Removes `[QuarantinedTest]` |
| `/disable-test` | Disable test(s) due to an active issue | `[ActiveIssue]` |
| `/enable-test` | Re-enable previously disabled test(s) | Removes `[ActiveIssue]` |

### Syntax

```
/quarantine-test <test-name(s)> <issue-url> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
/unquarantine-test <test-name(s)> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
/disable-test <test-name(s)> <issue-url> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
/enable-test <test-name(s)> [--target-pr <pr-url>]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `<test-name(s)>` | Yes | One or more test method names (space-separated) |
| `<issue-url>` | For quarantine/disable | URL of the GitHub issue tracking the problem |
| `--target-pr <pr-url>` | No | Push changes to an existing PR instead of creating a new one |

### Examples

#### Quarantine a flaky test (creates new PR)
```
/quarantine-test MyTestClass.MyTestMethod https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/1234
```

#### Quarantine multiple tests
```
/quarantine-test TestMethod1 TestMethod2 TestMethod3 https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/1234
```

#### Quarantine a test and push to an existing PR
```
/quarantine-test MyTestMethod https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/1234 --target-pr https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/pull/5678
```

#### Unquarantine a test (creates new PR)
```
/unquarantine-test MyTestClass.MyTestMethod
```

#### Unquarantine and push to an existing PR
```
/unquarantine-test MyTestMethod --target-pr https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/pull/5678
```

#### Disable a test due to an active issue
```
/disable-test MyTestMethod https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/1234
```

#### Enable a previously disabled test
```
/enable-test MyTestMethod
```

#### Comment on a PR to push changes to that PR
When you comment on a PR (not an issue), the workflow will automatically push changes to that PR's branch instead of creating a new PR. You can override this by specifying `--target-pr`.

### Behavior

1. **Permission Check**: Only users with write access to the repository can use these commands.
2. **Processing Indicator**: The workflow adds an 👀 reaction to your comment when it starts processing.
3. **Status Comments**: The workflow posts comments to indicate:
   - ⏳ Processing started
   - ✅ Success (with link to created/updated PR)
   - ℹ️ No changes needed (test already in desired state)
   - ❌ Failure (with error details)

### Target PR Behavior

| Context | `--target-pr` specified | Result |
|---------|-------------------------|--------|
| Comment on Issue | No | Creates new PR from `main` |
| Comment on Issue | Yes | Pushes to specified PR |
| Comment on PR | No | Pushes to that PR's branch |
| Comment on PR | Yes | Pushes to specified PR (overrides) |

### Restrictions

- The `--target-pr` URL must be from the same repository
- Cannot push to PRs from forks
- Cannot push to closed PRs
- The PR branch must not be protected in a way that prevents pushes

### Concurrency

The workflow uses concurrency groups based on the issue/PR number to prevent race conditions when multiple commands are issued on the same issue.

## Backmerge Release Workflow

The `backmerge-release.yml` workflow automatically creates PRs to merge changes from `release/13.3` back into `main`.

### Schedule

Runs daily at 00:00 UTC (4pm PT during standard time, 5pm PT during daylight saving time). Can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.

### Behavior

1. **Change Detection**: Checks if `release/13.3` has commits not in `main`
2. **PR Creation**: If changes exist, creates a PR to merge `release/13.3` → `main`
3. **Auto-merge**: Enables GitHub's auto-merge feature, so the PR merges automatically once approved
4. **Conflict Handling**: If merge conflicts occur, creates an issue instead of a PR

### Assignees

PRs and conflict issues are automatically assigned to @joperezr and @radical.

### Manual Trigger

To trigger manually, go to Actions → "Backmerge Release to Main" → "Run workflow".
